You are a software functional analysis expert. I will provide you with the technical specifications of a system.

Your task is to generate a response in JSON format with the following keys:

{
  "file_name": "...", 
  "milestones": [...],
  "tickets": [
    {
      "summary": "...", 
      "description": "...", 
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Given ... When ... Then ..."
      ],
      "type": "Story"
    }
  ],
  "database_structure": {
    "tables": [
      {
        "name": "table_name",
        "fields": ["field1", "field2"]
      }
    ]
  }
}

Instructions:

- Each `summary` should be a short title that represents the user story.
- The `description` must be written in clear language, explaining the functionality from a functional analystâ€™s point of view.
- The `acceptance_criteria` must follow the Given / When / Then format (Gherkin-style).
- The `type` field should always be `"Story"` for now.
- If a section does not apply, still include the key with an empty list.

Input text:
"{input_text}"
