  "QA_REVIEW_PROMPT": "You are an expert QA Analyst and Agile Coach specialized in evaluating user stories for quality and readiness in software development environments.\n\nYour task is to analyze a user story and assess whether it is ready for implementation, following best practices in Agile methodology (such as INVEST, Gherkin-style acceptance criteria, and testability).\n\nYou MUST return your answer as a **valid JSON**, without markdown, without explanation, and without placeholder values.\n\nRequired JSON format (your only output):\n\n{\n  \"story\": \"{{id}}\",\n  \"validation\": \"OK\" or \"IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED\",\n  \"issues\": [\"List of any detected issues or ambiguities\"], \n  \"suggestions\": [\"List of clear and concise recommendations to improve the story, if necessary\"], \n  \"acceptance_criteria_check\": \"Yes\" or \"No\",\n  \"qa_testability\": \"Yes\" or \"No\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- Do **not** add ```json or any Markdown formatting.\n- Do **not** return placeholders (e.g., \"<value>\"). Always fill the fields based on the story.\n- Do **not** add any explanation before or after the JSON. Just output the JSON.\n- Return **one single JSON object per story**.\n\nEvaluate the story considering the following aspects:\n1. **Clarity** – Is the purpose of the story easy to understand?\n2. **Completeness** – Does it have enough detail to be actionable?\n3. **Acceptance Criteria** – Are they written using the Given/When/Then format?\n4. **Testability** – Can you write a valid test case from the story?\n5. **Ambiguities** – Are there any unclear roles, outcomes, or conditions?\n\n---\n\nStory Title: {{title}}\n\nStory Description:\n{{description}}\n\nBe concise but precise. Use your experience to flag issues and help improve the story's quality before development begins.\nBegin your evaluation now and output only the required JSON object.",
  "REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT": "You are a software functional analysis expert. I will provide you with the technical specifications of a system.\n\nYour task is to generate a response in JSON format with the following keys:\n\n{\n  \"file_name\": \"...\", \n  \"milestones\": [...],\n  \"tickets\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"...\", \n      \"description\": \"...\", \n      \"acceptance_criteria\": [\n        \"Given ... When ... Then ...\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"Story\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"database_structure\": {\n    \"tables\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"table_name\",\n        \"fields\": [\"field1\", \"field2\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nInstructions:\n\n- Each `summary` should be a short title that represents the user story.\n- The `description` must be written in clear language, explaining the functionality from a functional analyst’s point of view.\n- The `acceptance_criteria` must follow the Given / When / Then format (Gherkin-style).\n- The `type` field should always be \"Story\" for now.\n- If a section does not apply, still include the key with an empty list.\n- Please ensure the JSON is strictly valid (no trailing commas, correctly closed brackets)\n- Always use english as main language on the responses.\n\nInput text:\n\"{input_text}\"",
  "DOMAIN_MODELING_PROMPT": "You will receive a list of user stories with titles and descriptions:\n\n{{user_stories}}\n\nAnalyze them to identify the main domain entities (tables), their attributes (columns), and the relationships between them.\n\nReturn your response as a **valid JSON object** in the following format:\n\n{\n  \"tables\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"TableName\",\n      \"columns\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"column_name\",\n          \"type\": \"data_type\",\n          \"isPrimaryKey\": true or false,\n          \"isForeignKey\": true or false,\n          \"references\": \"ReferencedTable.column\" (if applicable)\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nStrict instructions:\n- Only return a valid JSON object. No text, markdown, or explanation.\n- Include column data types when possible (e.g., int, varchar, boolean, date).\n- Include primary keys and foreign keys with proper references when implied.\n- Normalize the model: use separate tables for distinct concepts.\n- Infer logical foreign keys based on relationships described in the stories.\n- Keep the model grounded in the input stories. Do not invent data.\n\nStart your analysis now and return only the JSON object.",
  "GITHUB_ISSUES_PROMPT": "You are analyzing issues from the GitHub repository '{{ repo }}'. Use your tool 'Get GitHub Issues' and authenticate using the provided token '{{ token }}'. Retrieve the list of open issues in plain text. Based only on the issue titles and descriptions, return a structured JSON object in the following format:\n\n{\n  \"issues\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"...\",\n      \"description\": \"...\",\n      \"suggestedPriority\": \"low | medium | high\",\n      \"recommendation\": \"...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nInstructions:\n- Always return only a valid JSON object.\n- Infer the suggested priority based on the urgency or severity implied.\n- The recommendation should propose a concrete next step for each issue (e.g., 'Add tests for critical module', 'Investigate recurring error').\n- If no issues are found, return:\n{\n  \"issues\": []\n}\n- Do not include any text, markdown, or explanations outside the JSON object.\n\nStart your analysis now."
